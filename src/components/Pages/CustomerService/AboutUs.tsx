                <br /> Hello! You might have thought that ‚ÄúABOUT US‚Äù implies a
                team, but this service was created by me alone. As an aspiring
                frontend developer, I pondered what was necessary in real life
                and ended up creating this service. Don‚Äôt you create a joint
                account with your partner when dating? However, in most cases,
                it‚Äôs difficult to manage expenditure records easily because one
                side unilaterally manages the money. Also, bank-related apps
                only show expenditure records, making it inconvenient to see
                exactly where and how the money was spent, and there‚Äôs almost no
                filtering using categories. To solve these problems, I planned a
                couple‚Äôs consumption management service and implemented it. The
                start may be humble, but starting from alleviating small
                inconveniences, my goal is to become a developer who can provide
                services that alleviate many people‚Äôs inconveniences in the
                future. Although it‚Äôs insufficient, I would appreciate it if you
                could use my service well. Lastly, I want to express my
                gratitude to my love, Gayoung, who has helped me in planning
                this service.
